# Remote Two/3 WebSocket Core-API

**Version:** 0.31.0-beta  
**License:** Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-SA 4.0)  
**Documentation:** https://www.unfoldedcircle.com/  
**Support:** https://github.com/unfoldedcircle/core-api/issues  

## Overview

The Unfolded Circle Remote Core-APIs consist of:
- This WebSocket API
- The [UCR REST Core-API](https://github.com/unfoldedcircle/core-api/tree/main/core-api/rest)

The remote-core service acts as WebSocket server. Whenever the remote enters standby it may choose to disconnect client connections.

The focus of the Core-APIs is to provide all functionality for the UI application and the web-configurator. They allow to interact with the Unfolded Circle remote-core service and take full control of its features.

The Core-APIs may also be used by other external systems and integration drivers, if specific configuration or interaction features are required, which are not present in the [UCR Integration-API](https://github.com/unfoldedcircle/core-api/tree/main/integration-api).

## API Versioning

The API is versioned according to [SemVer](https://semver.org/). The initial public release will be `1.0.0` once it is considered stable enough with some initial integration implementations and developer examples.

**Any major version zero (`0.y.z`) is for initial development and may change at any time!** Backward compatibility for minor releases is not yet established, anything MAY change at any time!

## WebSocket Connection

### Authentication

Interaction with the API requires an API-key, user account or a session cookie (see login operation in the REST Core-API).

#### Basic Authentication
A user account can be used with [basic authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication) in the WebSocket upgrade.

- **Header name:** `Authentication`
- **Value:** `Basic ` + base64 encoded value of `${username}:${password}`

#### API-key Authentication
If the session based login is not possible or the client needs to use an API-key, then the preferred way to establish an authenticated WebSocket connection is to provide the API-key in the header of the WebSocket connection.

- **Header name:** `API-KEY`
- **Value:** API key

API keys can be created with the REST API and the `auth/api_keys` endpoints.

#### Message Based Authentication
If the client cannot provide the API-key in the connection setup (e.g. a web browser), the server will send the `auth_required` message right after the connection is established.

The client must reply with the `auth` message containing the API-key.

- All other messages will be ignored, until the client successfully authenticates itself.
- The server will close an unauthenticated connection after a timeout of 15 seconds.

The server replies with the `authentication` event including the result code of the authentication:
- `200`: authentication succeeded, API can be used.
- `401`: invalid authentication and the connection will be closed.

## Key Messages

### System Commands

#### ping/pong
🚀 Application level based ping to determine whether connection is alive. Additional payload data may be included in `msg_data` which will be echoed by the server.

#### version
🚀 Get version information.

#### system
🚀 Get system information - hardware information about the device like serial number, model number and hardware revision.

#### system_cmd
🧪 Perform a system command like reboot or power-off.

The following system commands can be executed:
- `STANDBY`: Put the device into standby mode.
- `REBOOT`: Reboot the device.
- `POWER_OFF`: Switch off the device
- `RESTART`: Restart all applications.
- `RESTART_UI`: Restart the ui application.
- `RESTART_CORE`: Restart the core service application.

### Power Management

#### get_power_mode
